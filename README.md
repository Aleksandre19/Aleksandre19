I have more than six years of experience in software development. This time has given me the opportunity to prioritize my skills. I love to work with Python, Django, and JavaScript.

Typically, I start the development process by researching the project area and exploring similar ones. I identify the pros and cons, and ultimately synthesize the project's ideas and needs to the possibilities, technologies and experience. 

The process continues in Figma, where I start sketching different ideas, gradually moving to the design phase. After continuously testing and refining the design, the prototyping completes the UX/UI.

Once the UX/UI is ready, things get more fun. I mostly use the Django framework to build web applications. First, I install Django and immediately create a Custom User Model, followed by all necessary configurations in settings.py. After building the basic template structure, front-end development begins. I create the structure of the web application using HTML5, apply CSS3, and finish with JavaScript by implementing the user interaction aspect of the project. My favorite part of front-end development is working with JavaScript. If needed, I also use Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, or jQuery.

Now the project has visuals, and all user interaction elements are functional. It may seem finished, but my favorite phase is about to begin. This involves structuring database tables, defining their connections, and creating models accordingly. After working on the models, it's time for views, which I particularly enjoy, as they generally involve logic implementation and data manipulation using Python or Django's built-in functions.

Finally, if the project requires a payment system, I implement it using the Stripe API or PayPal.

This is a general workflow of the development process, and it's not set in stone. I just wanted to demonstrate my awareness of the various stages, aspects, and nuances involved in development.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page. I wish you successful development.
